the purpose of this project is to create a software to easily keep track of daily activities. I want to do this using sql database, powershell, and python. I need an sql interpreter though. I could use mysql or sqlite. mysql requires to run a server, which I likely would not have permissions for, while sqlite just runs on a file. sqlite does not have as many data types, but it should not be an issue if I am just storing dates and text.

Another feature to include in this software is a report generator. the whole point of this is to more easily keep track of tasks, and that would be difficult if all the data is kept in a database.

we decide to go with sqlite because of the self-contained nature of the data base. the software was easily installed, and a test database was created. To interact with the database, we installed an object relational mapper through python.
